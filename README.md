# Project Strimz Shop - Full E-commerce (Extension for Music Website)

**Deployed Website:** [Strimz Shop](https://strimz-shop.netlify.app/)

## 🛒🎶 Description

**Strimz Shop** is a full e-commerce platform developed as an extension of the Strimz Empire music label website. Spanning nine months of work (January to October 2024), this project focused on creating a fully functional online store using React. The shop offers various products like albums, tickets, and merchandise, with features such as user login, real-time product search, a dynamic cart system, and a "favorites" page where users can add or remove items.

## 💻🔧 Development Experience

Being my first large project using React, I encountered many challenges that pushed me to learn quickly. I had the opportunity to practice building components, which gave me a new perspective on programming. Unlike working with pure HTML, React allowed me to create dynamic and reusable components, which I could edit in one place without duplicating code.

Additionally, I used React Router, enabling smooth navigation between pages without reloading. This functionality greatly improved the responsiveness and efficiency of the application.

Firebase played a key role in managing product data, allowing real-time addition, editing, and display of products on product pages. The JSON-based database structure made it easy to organize product information, and any changes made to the database were instantly reflected on the site. This solution simplified content editing and updating. Moreover, Firebase allowed me to implement a product search feature, which searches the database in real-time based on user input, providing a seamless shopping experience.

Managing state in my project with Redux Toolkit was initially a challenge, as I had no prior experience with this technology. I faced difficulties with implementing the cart state management, but I eventually got it working. With Redux Toolkit, I was able to organize the app's logic better, which simplified state management. I created slices for various functionalities like the cart, favorites, and forms. This approach helped me maintain cleaner code and simplified data handling throughout the application.

I tested the code mainly manually, using tools like Lighthouse and testing the application on various devices to ensure smooth performance. While I initially planned to use automated testing tools like Vitest or Cypress, the project's lengthy timeline (9 months) led me to conclude the project without implementing them.

To give the shop a more diverse and realistic appearance, I used pre-made product **mockup** templates. I customized these mockups by overlaying my own cover art and graphics using **Photoshop**, such as album covers on CD templates or t-shirts with album-themed designs. This approach not only enhanced the shop's assortment but also added a unique touch to the product pages, aligning with the branding of my music label.

## 💡📈  Reflections

Working on this project made me realize the importance of better planning and a more realistic approach to time management. Initially, I expected the project to take less time, but the complexity and scale quickly overwhelmed me. Although I managed to complete all the key features, the process took much longer than I had anticipated. However, the experience deepened my knowledge of React, especially in creating reusable components and managing the application's state. I gained valuable experience, but I know there's still much to learn, both in terms of React's advanced features and better application logic management.
